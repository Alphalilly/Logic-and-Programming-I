Nothing to see here lol. Just a college thing.

Learning some C#, and programing over all for the first time.

Not much else I can say about it. You'll probably see some noobie code that its only purpose to exist is for me learning, lol.
And lots of typos in places where typos shouldnt exist.

but yeah. uh have a nice day whoever you are :3.
